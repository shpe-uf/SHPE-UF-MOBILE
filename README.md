# SHPE-UF-MOBILE
This is the repository for the newly-envisioned mobile version of the original SHPE-UF. It will focus mostly on user-centered features, as opposed to admin ones (coming on later releases))

# Training
If you're a new developer joining our team, chances are that you will need to do a lot of learning before you can actually develop. This training **is required** before you can be officially admitted to the team.

You will be watching videos from Harvard's CS50 series of courses. This course is on Mobile Development with React Native, but it teaches you the basics of Javascript and React before moving to the Native side.

[Harvard's CS50 Mobile Development:](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50M+Mobile/1fce05f1372540988dd5c24d1bf03a7e/)
- Lecture 1: Overview, JavaScript
- Lecture 2: JavaScript, ES6
- Lecture 3: React, Props, State
- Lecture 4: React Native
- Lecture 5: Lists, User Input
- Lecture 6: User Input, Debugging

Keep in mind that the lectures are around 1.5-2hrs long. We recommend watching 2 lectures per week, while also leaving time to work on some of the projects presented in these lectures.
**Projects are NOT required**, but they will give you a good understanding and practice before starting to work in the application.

# Getting Started
This project will consist of programming the Front-End using Javascript and the ReactNative framework. React Native is javascript framework that allows for multiplatform app development, and as a result, you can develop in whichever environment you see fit.

## New to Git and Github?
If those words sound strange to you, or you've never used either, it is a good idea for you to get acclimated with them before you begin development.   

You can get started with GitHub [here](https://guides.github.com/). Only read sections:
- Understanding the Git workflow
- Hello World

## Setting up your editor of choice
Now that you know what Git and Github are all about, you can set up your editor to work in unison with them. This guy only shows the process for Visual Studio Code, but other text editors and IDEs have similar functionality.

First you can download [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short), you can integrate [Github with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).

If you prefer watching a video, you can watch this short guide explaining how to use the [Github extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol) for VSCode.

## Setting up the React Native workflow
Before you can begin working with React Native, you will need to isntall the tools that Expo offers, and making sure that you can create a simple app and 
run it in your mobile device.

[React Native Official Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/) offers everythign you need to get started. Make sure that you always follow the Expo set up.

## Starting the Project
To being working on the project, first you will need to install all the dependencies. On your terminal, run:
```
npm install
```

(OPTINONAL) If you want to use the Expo CLI (Command Line Interface), you will need to install it. On your terminal run:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Running the Poject
Using NodeJS:
```
npm expo start
```

Using ExpoCLI:
```
expo start
```

### Running Expo on your phone
If you want to use your phone to debug instead of the user interface:
1. Install the Expo App on your phone
2. Sign-in to Expo on the CLI (instructions for this appear on your terminal everytime you run expo)
